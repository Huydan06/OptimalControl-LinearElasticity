# Optimal control problem
This project is an implementation of the numerical algorithm for the bound constraints optimal control problems in linear elasticity. This strategy is based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) and implemented in FreeFEM++ software.

### Freefem++ installation
To begin, download and install the most recent version of [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/). The version Freefem++ 4.5 was used to create this program.
